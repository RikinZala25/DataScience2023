    "#### Inactivity and Saving\n",
    "\n",
    "- After 15 minutes of inactivity, the Python kernel shuts down, but the kernel is easy to restart if you continue your work within 60 minutes.\n",
    "- After 60 minutes of inactivity the data is deleted to free up resources for other users.\n",
    "- Therefore, please save the notebook locally (click \"File\" -> \"Download\") if you are pausing your work on the notebook for more than one hour. (We have put a reminder to save the notebook after each task.)\n",
    "- If you have to restore your work from a downloaded notebook, press the Upload Button and select your locally saved `.ipynb` file (confirm to overwrite).\n",

    "#### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "- Solve the six tasks in this notebook and use the next learning item in the course (\"Solution sheet: SQL Quiz\") to insert your questions. Till the due date (which is **the 27th of June (11:55 pm / 23:55 UTC**), you can revise your answers. Only after the deadline, we will publish the results of this assignment, once this is done, you can discuss your answers and approach in the forum.\n",
