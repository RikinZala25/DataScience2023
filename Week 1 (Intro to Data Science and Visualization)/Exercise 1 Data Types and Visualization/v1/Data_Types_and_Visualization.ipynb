    "\n",
    "- After 15 minutes of inactivity, the Python kernel shuts down, but the kernel is easy to restart if you continue your work within 60 minutes.\n",
    "- After 60 minutes of inactivity the data is deleted to free up resources for other users.\n",
    "- Therefore, please save the notebook locally (click \"File\" -> \"Download\") if you are pausing your work on the notebook for more than one hour. (We have put a reminder to save the notebook after each task.)\n",

    "- The due date for this exercise is the **27th of June (11:55 pm / 23:55 UTC)**\n",
    "- The grading process relies on the existing cell order.\n",
    "- Therefore: Do not create new cells and do not delete existing cells in the notebook.\n",
    "- If you need/want to create new cells in the notebook, you can add them after the grading code.\n",

It provides a variety of tools for creating high-quality charts, plots, and graphs, making it an essential tool for data scientists, engineers, and researchers. Matplotlib allows you to create a wide range of visualizations, including line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, and more. The library is highly customizable, allowing you to adjust every aspect of your visualizations to match your needs. Matplotlib can be used in combination with other Python libraries, such as NumPy and Pandas, to create more complex visualizations and perform data analysis tasks. Overall, Matplotlib is a powerful and flexible tool that can help you explore and communicate your data effectively.\n",
